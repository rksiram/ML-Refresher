Machine Learning Refresher

The process of learning deep learning typically follows a sequence that builds foundational knowledge and progressively delves into more advanced topics. Here's a step-by-step guide:

/*1. Foundations of Mathematics and Programming
* Linear Algebra: Understand vectors, matrices, matrix multiplication, and eigenvalues.
* Calculus: Grasp derivatives, gradients, and partial derivatives.
* Probability and Statistics: Learn about distributions, expectations, and Bayes' theorem.
* Programming: Gain proficiency in Python and tools like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
